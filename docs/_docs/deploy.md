The pipeline is generated from the DSL and created with CloudFormation. The files that the DSL evaluates are in the `.codepipeline` folder:

    .codepipeline/pipeline.rb
    .codepipeline/role.rb
    .codepipeline/schedule.rb
    .codepipeline/webhook.rb

To create the CodePipeline pipeline, you run:

    pipe deploy

You'll see output that looks something like this:

    $ pipe deploy
    Generated CloudFormation template at /tmp/codepipeline.yml
    Deploying stack demo-pipe with CodePipeline project demo
    Creating stack demo-pipe. Check CloudFormation console for status.

## Explicit Pipeline Name

By default, the pipeline name is inferred and is the parent folder name that you are within.  You can explicitly specify the pipeline name as the first CLI argument:

    pipe deploy my-pipeline

## Specify Git Branch

It is useful to build pipelines with different source git branches. You can pass a `--branch` option to the `pipe deploy` command. The cli `â€”-branch` option always takes the highest precedence. Example:

    pipe deploy my-pipeline --branch my-branch

Note: When you specify a branch the codepipeline tool actually first updates the pipeline before starting the pipeline execution. This is done because CodePipeline does not natively support specifying the branch. It is discussed more here: [Using Different Branches]({% link _docs/examples/different-branches.md %}).

## CLI Reference

Also, for help info you can check the [pipe deploy]({% link _reference/pipe-deploy.md %}) CLI reference.
